Today was my first experience actually using the documentation to figure things out and it felt very good. Unit testing has always been something I have disliked because firstly it seemed very unnessesary and secondly because there is a lot of syntax that is unfamiliar. Such syntax such as using words like describe, it, and expect. 

Well having finished my assignment early I decided to play around and see what other tests I could run. Upon browsing through tests I found two assertions that were perfect for what I was trying to test. The expect toBeGreaterThan and toBeLessThan was perfect because I was testing two function that took an object and in one function returned a modified version of that object with a property with an increased value and the other where the value was decreased.

I know it isn't the coolest thing in the world but this was the first successfull atempt at actually getting something out of the documentations. Now i am empowered knowing how to work with 3rd party libraries.
## Learning how to use Jekyll

A few months ago I tried learning how to use Jekyll, Github Pages and more and was so lost compared to now. It only took me a few days to learn the basics of both. I am actually learning how to use Jekyll as I am writing this post. I am learning how to write posts using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)


* Using a star for bullet ponts
* Double star for bold text
* Square brackets followed by parenthesis for links
* *text wrapperd with stars for italics*
*  **Bold text wrapped with double stars**
* Headers using double octothorps

> The biggest takeaway today is being able to read and understand code from third party sources because as a web developer a majority of your time is spent reading and understanding other peoples code.

This is my first real proffessional blog post. And although I am writing from first person point of view my hope is that other developers can relate to these experiences along their journeys.
